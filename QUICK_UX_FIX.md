# Quick Guide: Node Group Panel UX Fix

## The Problem

Dark background overlay was obscuring the content and making it hard to read.

```
❌ BEFORE: Harsh Dark Overlay (30% opacity)
─────────────────────────────────────────
The panel appears in a very dark, oppressive environment
that makes text hard to read and creates visual fatigue.
```

## The Solution

Reduced opacity and fixed z-index layering for a cleaner look.

```
✅ AFTER: Subtle Light Overlay (10% opacity)
─────────────────────────────────────────
The panel appears with a light, subtle background
that's easy on the eyes and maintains readability.
```

## What Changed

| Aspect | Before | After | Impact |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| **Opacity** | 30% | 10% | ✅ 66% lighter |
| **Z-Index** | Same for all (confusing) | Layered correctly | ✅ Proper stacking |
| **Readability** | ❌ Poor | ✅ Excellent | ✅ Better UX |
| **Visual Feel** | Heavy/Dark | Light/Clean | ✅ Modern |

## Code Changes

### Backdrop Styling
```typescript
// BEFORE
<div class="fixed inset-0 bg-black/30 z-[55]"></div>

// AFTER
<div class="position-fixed bg-black opacity-10 z-40" style="inset: 0"></div>
```
